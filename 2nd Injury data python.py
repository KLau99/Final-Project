# NFL 1st and Future 2019
## Can you investigate the relationship between the playing surface and the injury and performance of NFL athletes?

![](https://1ycbx02rgnsa1i87hd1i7v1r-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/nfl.png)

This kernel is made in hopes of helping those interested in joining the competition get a jump start on the data. Much of the text was taken directly from the competition description. However be sure to read the official rules and data description on the kaggle website [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/nfl-playing-surface-analytics).

tl;dr:
  
  **In this challenge, you're tasked to investigate the relationship between the playing surface and the injury and performance of National Football League (NFL) athletes and to examine factors that may contribute to lower extremity injuries.**

Submissions will be judged by the NFL based on how well they address:
- Representation of player movement, including, but not limited to, the development of novel metrics that characterize player movement on the field:
- Identification of specific variables that present an elevated risk of injury:
- Evaluation of differences in player movement between playing surfaces:

Submissions will be scored using the following rubric:
- Creativity and Presentation (5 points)
- Methodology (5 points)
- Application (5 points)

# Data:
There are three files provided in the dataset, as described below:

1. **Injury Record:** The injury record file in .csv format contains information on 105 lower-limb injuries that occurred during regular season games over the two seasons. Injuries can be linked to specific records in a player history using the PlayerKey, GameID, and PlayKey fields.

2. **Play List:** – The play list file contains the details for the 267,005 player-plays that make up the dataset. Each play is indexed by PlayerKey, GameID, and PlayKey fields. Details about the game and play include the player’s assigned roster position, stadium type, field type, weather, play type, position for the play, and position group.

3. **Player Track Data:** player level data that describes the location, orientation, speed, and direction of each player during a play recorded at 10 Hz (i.e. 10 observations recorded per second).


# Read the input files

## Injury Data
First lets look at the injury data. It's a fairly small file with only 105 injury plays shown. I notice that many of the rows for the injury plays do not show `PlayerKey`, `GameId`, etc. I'm not sure if this is a bug or intentially done.

- PlayerKey, GameId, PlayKey
- BodyPart
- Surface
- DM_M1, DM_M7, DM_28, DM_42 - One hot encoding the number of days missed for injury
